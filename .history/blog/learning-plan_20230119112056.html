            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
            <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to enter the tech industry by first finding a job related to front-end development and
                would like to extend my knowledge in back-end development in the long term.
            </p>
            <h3>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
            <p>My strengths are curiosity, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. I am curious about new things and love to spend time learning them. When I encounter issues, I would firstly come up with an idea and try it. If it does not work, I would keep seeking another one until it is solved.</p>
            <p>My limitation is sometimes spending too much time resolving one problem by myself. I am supposed to turn to someone else for help if the problem cannot be solved within a specific amount of time.</p>
            <h3>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
            <p>My strengths are honesty, curiosity, self-regulation and perseverance. With honesty, I would act
                genuinely and sincerely without pretending and cheating. Curiosity inspires me to explore unknown area
                and discover it. Self-regulation keeps me being disciplined and makes me concentrate on the goals.
                Perseverance helps me to continuously seek solutions to complete tasks in spite of obstacles.</p>
            <h3>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I might not have much of the leadership. I am not very keen on organising group activities and
                encouraging others to do things. I enjoyed being a team member and achieved the same goal through
                collaboration. I hope it would not affect much of my learning journey, I just do not want to be the
                actual leader but would definitely take initiatives to contribute to the group work.</p>
            <h3>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance
                or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
                what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            <p>When I was doing an online course, there was a group task which was a part of the assessments. When we
                had our first online meeting, it took a long time for us to decide what to do. Some came without knowing
                the requirements of the task, and some came without any ideas of what to do. The meeting could not
                continue with only one or two people were contributing. At that time, we broke the task into small tasks
                and assigned those tasks to group members, and set time for another meeting. This was effective as
                everyone was clear about what to do and the deadline.</p>
            <p>Other strategies that I would try now is to set a meeting agenda and list all the things that the members
                have to do before the group meeting. It would increase the productivity.</p>
