            <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
            <h3>1.What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to enter the tech industry by first finding a job related to front-end development and would like to extend my knowledge in back-end development in the long term.
            </p>
           
               
            <h3>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>In my culture, people tend to be humble, reserved and not express emotions. Since I went overseas, the
                people I met and the environment have re-shaped my values and identity. Living in a multicultural
                society, there are heaps of opportunities to experience various cultures, different ways of doing
                things, different life attitudes and values. I used to be a person who does not know how to express love
                and hide feelings and emotions all the time. I really appreciated the people I met at my first teaching
                job. They are the most beautiful people I have met. They showed me how to love and care the people
                around and made me feel I also have the ability to do the same thing. </p>
            <h3>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
            <p>My strengths are honesty, curiosity, self-regulation and perseverance. With honesty, I would act
                genuinely and sincerely without pretending and cheating. Curiosity inspires me to explore unknown area
                and discover it. Self-regulation keeps me being disciplined and makes me concentrate on the goals.
                Perseverance helps me to continuously seek solutions to complete tasks in spite of obstacles.</p>
            <h3>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>I might not have much of the leadership. I am not very keen on organising group activities and encouraging others to do things. I enjoyed being a team member and achieved the same goal through collaboration. I hope it would not affect much of my learning journey, I just do not want to be the actual leader but would definitely take initiatives to contribute to the group work.</p>
            <h3>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            <p>When I was doing an online course, there was a group task which was a part of the assessments. When we had our first online meeting, it took a long time for us to decide what to do. Some came without knowing the requirements of the task, and some came without any ideas of what to do. The meeting could not continue with only one or two people were contributing. At that time, we broke the task into small tasks and assigned those tasks to group members, and set time for another meeting. This was effective as everyone was clear about what to do and the deadline.</p>
            <p>Other strategies that I would try now is to set a meeting agenda and list all the things that the members have to do before the group meeting. It would increase the productivity.</p>
