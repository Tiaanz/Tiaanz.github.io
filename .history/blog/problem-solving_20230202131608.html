            <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
            <h3>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I was blocked on a simple problem when I was trying to add properties to an object with the
                <code>ForEach()</code> loop.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/problem1.png" alt="problem1">
            <p>This code did not result in an object gradebook with a property for each student in the students array.
                Instead, it will only created a single property student in gradebook and assign an empty object {} to it
                in each iteration of the loop.</p>
            <p>As I knew there was another way to add object properties, which is
                <code>objectName[‘propertyName’]</code>. I experimented with this approach and it worked.
            </p>
            <p>The problem is that student is a variable and its value is not being used to dynamically set the property
                name in the gradebook object.</br>
                This problem solving process was not that hard, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of objects.
            </p>
            <h3>2. A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I got a problem as I was doing the <code>capitalization()</code> function. The problem was I was able to get the
                first letter of each word in upper case, but the rest part of the word disappeared.</br> 
                For example, I was
                hoping to get ‘Hello World’ with the function capitalization( ‘hello world’), but turned out to be ‘H
                W’. I could not come up with a solution so I just googled ‘how to get a sentence capitalized in
                JavaScript?’, then I knew that a <code></code>slice() method can be used to get the rest part of the word and then
                the “+” can be used to connect the capital letter with other letters. I was struggled for a while with
                the problem but it did not take me too long to get it solved.

            <h3>3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
            <p>DOM is the abbreviation for Document Object Model. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a
                Document Object Model of the page. With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements
                of an HTML document.</p>
            <p>
                For example, I can use JavaScript to change the color of the h1 title in the page. Moreover, I can
                change the content of the p tag by clicking a button.
                Furthermore, I can add new HTML elements to the page when needed.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Accessing array data:</b> You access an array element by referring to the index number: </li>
                <li>Array indexes start with 0.<br />
                    [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.</li>
                <li><img src="../images/array.png" alt="array"></li>
                <li><b>Accessing object data:</b> You can access object properties in two ways: </li>
                <li style="font-weight: 600;"><i>1). objectName.propertyName</i></li>
                <li><img src="../images/object1.png" alt="object"></li>
                <li style="font-weight:600"><i>2). objectName["propertyName"]</i></li>
                <li><img src="../images/object2.png" alt="object"></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
            <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when
                "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
            <p>Functions are helpful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1). You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</li>
                <li>2). You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
                </li>
            </ul>
