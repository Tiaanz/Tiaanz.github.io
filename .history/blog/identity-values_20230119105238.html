            <h1> Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
            <h4>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values
                involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
            <p>
                There was a situation where I have made an ethical decision when I was at work. I was an early childhood
                teacher and worked within a team with other teachers. One of our responsibilities is to communicate what
                the babyâ€™s life here at the day care with parents through a communication book. Each teacher has 3 or 4
                children they are responsible for. There was one day that one of the teachers had to go for a meeting
                and do not have time to complete the communication book before parents coming. She expressed her
                worriedness to me so I said I would do it for her and let her not worry about it.
