            <h1> Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
            <h3>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values
                involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
            <p>
                There was a situation where I have made an ethical decision when I was at work. I was an early childhood
                teacher and worked within a team with other teachers. One of our responsibilities is to communicate what
                the babyâ€™s life here at the day care with parents through a communication book. Each teacher has 3 or 4
                children they are responsible for. There was one day that one of the teachers had to go for a meeting
                and do not have time to complete the communication book before parents coming. She expressed her
                worriedness to me so I said I would do it for her and let her not worry about it.
            </p>
            <p>We were a team and we cared and covered each other. When facing parents or the external parties, we are
                not representing a single individual but the whole centre. We share the same goal and do our jobs to
                achieve the same goal, so I would definitely help my co-worker with that. </p>
            <p>I think I have made a wise decision. I let my co-worker know that I am thoughtful and care about them and
                really show them that we are working as a team. She appreciated what I did and also, she covered me when
                I needed help. That is the culture of a team we all want. </p>
            <h3>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>In my culture, people tend to be humble, reserved and not express emotions. Since I went overseas, the people I met and the environment have re-shaped my values and identity. Living in a multicultural society, there are heaps of opportunities to experience various cultures, different ways of doing things, different life attitudes and values. I used to be a person who does not know how to express love and hide feelings and emotions all the time. I really appreciated the people I met at my first teaching job. They are the most beautiful people I have met. They showed me how to love and care the people around and made me feel I also have the ability to do the same thing. </p>
