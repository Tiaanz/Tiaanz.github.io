            <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <h3>1. Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>neuroplasticity tells people that our brains are like malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped
                by our daily experiences. For example, if you keep practicing new things, you are causing different
                neurons to fire in concert, and it strengthens the connections between those cells. Over time, these
                connections become thick, hardy road maps that link various parts of the brain. Permanent learning
                therefore takes place.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
            <p>I would keep practicing coding. Even though I struggle to understand the logic of the code at first, I do not run away but keep repeating it. Everytime I repeat it, I stimulate the neurons to wire together and eventually build thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain. At the end, I will find myself mastering coding.</p>
            <h3>3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>Practice, practice and practice. Also, going out of the comfort zone and confront challenges and difficulties. Always looking for solutions rather than running away.</p>
