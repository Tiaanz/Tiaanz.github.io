            <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
            <h3>1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
            <p>I have identified my strengths and weaknesses. I believe that I could do anything I want with my
                perseverance and problem-solving skills. Also, it is so relieving to know the power of Neuroplasticity
                and growth mindset. I am not a smart person, but I can still achieve my goal as a developer with effort
                and practice. Last but not the least, the core learning introduced me mindfulness, which can be very
                helpful to overcome obstacles and frustrations.
            </p>
            <h3>2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>Values are a person’s belief in what is right and what is wrong. They guide us to do things right and
                keep us on the right track of learning.<br />
                Empathy helps us to understand others and foster collaboration within a team, which is important for
                group learning and future employment.<br />
                Self-awareness makes us know our strengths and limitations and make the most use of our strengths to
                achieve the goal.
            </p>
            <h3>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>I think it was neuroplasticity and growth mindset, as there has always been a stereotype that only clever
                people can code. These concepts really motivated me and gave me confidence in myself.</p>
            <h3>4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>The most challenging part was to explore myself to find out my strengths and limitations, my values and
                my identity. To be honest, I have not thought much about it before, but it was good that I had the
                chance to think about it and had a deeper understanding of myself.</p>
            <h3>5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a
                web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>To make us amazing human beings, hahaha. As we graduate and step into the workplace, we are not just
                being there to do some certain tasks, but also we are bringing ourselves to the team. What we are and
                what we do can influence as well as contribute to the team's success.</p>
            <h3>2. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>I am impressed with the power of growth mindset. Most of us are not born with high IQ or are extremely
                intelligent, however, it does not stop us from achieving success and happiness if we believe that our
                abilities can be developed through effort.</p>
            <h3>3. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>Whenever I encounter difficulties and want to run away, I would tell myself that it is ok to get
                struggled, just take your time and keep trying and you will get it sorted.</p>
            <h3>4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</h3>

                ">Stanford University’s Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset and Education</a></p>
            <h2>• Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
            <h3>1. Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
            </h3>
            <p>It gives me confidence in overcoming difficulties throughout the learning period. It enables me to
                believe that I am capable of doing anything if I put in effort and not defeated by it. Even though I am
                not that intelligent and new to the coding world, I am still able to achieve success through practice
                and perseverance. </p>
