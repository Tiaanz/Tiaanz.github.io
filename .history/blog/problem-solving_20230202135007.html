            <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>
            <h3>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I was blocked on a simple problem when I was trying to add properties to an object with the
                <code>ForEach()</code> loop.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/problem1.png" alt="problem1">
            <p>This code did not result in an object gradebook with a property for each student in the students array.
                Instead, it will only created a single property student in gradebook and assign an empty object {} to it
                in each iteration of the loop.</p>
            <p>As I knew there was another way to add object properties, which is
                <code>objectName[‘propertyName’]</code>. I experimented with this approach and it worked.
            </p>
            <p>The problem is that student is a variable and its value is not being used to dynamically set the property
                name in the gradebook object.</br>
                This problem solving process was not that hard, but it helped me gain a deeper understanding of objects.
            </p>
            <h3>2. A time I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
            <p>
                I got a problem as I was doing the <code>capitalization()</code> function. The problem was I was able to
                get the
                first letter of each word in upper case, but the rest part of the word disappeared.</br>
                For example, I was
                hoping to get ‘Hello World’ with the function capitalization( ‘hello world’), but turned out to be ‘H
                W’. I could not come up with a solution so I just googled ‘how to get a sentence capitalized in
                JavaScript?’, then I knew that a <code>slice()</code> method can be used to get the rest part of the
                word and then
                the “+” can be used to connect the capital letter with other letters. I was struggled for a while with
                the problem but it did not take me too long to get it solved.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>• Pseudocode</b>
                    <p>This is a helpful technique, as it helps to analyze the logic for each functionality.
                        By doing this, I will have an idea of what to do and just follow the steps to code instead of
                        getting lost in the middle of coding. I am still getting used to using this technique.
                    </p>
