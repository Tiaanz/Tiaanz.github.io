              <h1>Welcome to my blog</h1>
              <p>Kia ora! My name is Tian and I currently live in West Auckland. I am originally from China and have been in Aotearoa for 6 years.
                I was an early childhood teacher but made up my mind to make a career change to tech industry.
                Coding for me is exciting as well as frustrating and struggling when something just does not work. However, it is all deserved when you see the website
